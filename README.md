## Features

### **Bound Tools**
- **Create BOUND**: Creates a bounding box for the selected object with optional loop cuts for customization.

### **Export Tools**
- **Apply Origin and Transformations**: Sets the origin to the 3D cursor and applies all transformations (location, rotation, scale).
- **Apply Rotation & Scale + Origin**: Applies rotation and scale to the object and sets the origin to the center of mass (surface).
- **Sanity Check Collection**: Verifies that the required objects (`BODY_H`, `WHL0_H`, etc.) exist within the `Collection`. Ignores all other collections.

### **Material Tools**
- **Set Specular to 0.500**: Adjusts the Specular value of all materials in the selected objects to `0.500`.

### **Mesh Tools**
- **Rename UVs and VTX Colors**: Renames all UV maps to `"UV"` and vertex color layers to `"VTX"` for the selected objects.
